## General
This is a cheap DIY Lion 18650 battery discharger board. It features one LED so you get a visual indication if the battery is still providing power or not.

The discharge current is approx. 850mA which is fine for discharging a Lion 18650 battery with a capacity of 1500 - 3500 mAh.

The power dissipation of each 20 Ohm resistor is 0.8W at 4.0V and 0.45W at 3V.



## Requirements
The battery unit must contain an under-charged protection board.



## Parts
- 1x Perf board
- 4x Resistor 20 Ohm 3 Watt
- 7x LED 20mA 3V White
- 1x Terminal block connector 2-pin (pitch 5.08mm) plug-in with screws
- 1x Flashlight On Off switch (optional)
- 1x wooden plate
- 4x M20 mounting screws
- 4x spacers.

## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
