- Capacity: AA alkaline batteries typically have a capacity rating of +-2500mAh. 

- Combine 3x AA batteries and hook that up to the Adafruit HUZZAH32 development board using .

- @important When multiple cells are used in SERIES, as in a typical 2x 3x battery holder, the voltage goes up 2x 3x and the capacity in amp-hours stays the same!
- @important When multiple cells are used in PARALLEL, the voltage stays the same and the capacity in amp-hours goes up X times!

- Specs:
	+ Nominal Voltage: 1.5V
	+ High Voltage when full: 1.6V (when fully charged).
	+ Low Voltage: 0.9V (ESP32-Wifi stops working when using 3x AA batteries; 3x is 2.7V and I know it stops there).

- Advantages: 
	+ Cheap (12 pieces for 10EUR).
	+ Operating temperature range -20ºC to 54ºC. It can withstand much lower temperatures than Lion batteries!
	+ Using a battery holder with 3x AA batteries (4.5V) and soldering to a JST-PH2 battery connector (check polarity!) is perfect for powering an ESP32 ! The initial voltage is 4.7V when the batteries are fully loaded (this is safely below the max input voltage of 5V for the voltage regulator).

- Disadvantages:
	+ When powering an electronic high-power-draining-device like a digital camera, the Lion or NiMH battery types (with same capacity as AA Alkaline) will typically run 3x longer than AA :(
