## Project Description
This project is used to read the CO2 measurements, the related and derived measurements and the air quality index, continuously of **the Sensirion SCD30 CO2 and RH/T sensor**. Optionally, the project can use **an OLED 128x32/x64 SSD1306 display**.

The project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD ESP-IDF components "mjd_scd30" (sensor) and "mjd_ssd1306" (OLED) for the ESP32.

Please go to the component directories "**components/mjd_scd30**" and "**components/mjd_ssd1306**" for more documentation, installation and wiring instructions, data sheets, FAQ, photo's, etc.

## What are the HW SW requirements of the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit?

### Hardware

- A decent ESP32 development board. I suggest to buy a popular development board with good technical documentation and a significant user base. Examples: [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405),  [Espressif ESP32-DevKitC](http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview), [Pycom WiPy](https://pycom.io/hardware/), [Wemos D32](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d32:d32).
- The peripherals that are used in the project.

- @tip The README of each component contains a section "Shop Products".

  

### Software: ESP-IDF v3.2

- A working installation of the **Espressif ESP-IDF *V3.2* development framework**** (detailed instructions @ http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html).

```
mkdir ~/esp
cd    ~/esp
git clone -b v3.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v3.2
```

- A C Language editor or the Eclipse IDE CDT (instructions also @ http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html).

## Running the example

The project is used to read continuously in fixed intervals the CO2 measurements, the related and derived measurements and the air quality index, and to show it in the UART debug log and optionally on the OLED Display.

The metrics of each measurement:

- The output metrics of the SCD30 sensor: 
  - CO2 ppm
  - Temperature Celsius
  - Temperature Fahrenheit
  - Relative humidity %
- Some computed metrics:
  - EU IDA Air Quality Category
  - Dew point Celsius
  - Dew point Fahrenheit

The firmware also reports a summary of the averages, minima and maxima.



More info about the EU EN13779 Air Quality Standard for outdoor indoor:

- <https://www.airclean.co.uk/technical-bulletins/indoor-air-quality-european-standard/>
- <http://www.generalfilter.com/en/norms/en-13779/>





- Run `make menuconfig` and review/modify the section "MY PROJECT CONFIGURATION".
  Enable the OLED Display if you have wired up such a display device.
  @tip You can also change the log level in Components->Logging: use level INFO for normal operation, use level DEBUG for more detailed logging and to get insights in what the component is actually doing.
- Run `make flash monitor` to build and upload the example to your board and connect to its serial terminal.



## An extract of the UART Debugging Output

Note: the 1st and 2nd measurement readings are always ignored because those readings are often incorrect.

## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
